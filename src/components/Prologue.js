        Sherlock: Oh Watson, what a boring week it has been. Burglary and Identity Thefts, from<br />
      stolen money to missing residents. Nothing keeps me engaged beyond 4 hours.<br />
      Watson: Sherlock, you have not slept the last 3 days. If you’re bored why not just do that?<br />
      What is keeping you awake? Besides, we should be happy nothing bad is happening.<br />
      Sherlock: Nothing bad is being “reported”. You cannot believe everything you hear Doctor.<br />
      We spring up for action only when someone walks in through that door. But if they never<br />
      make it there to begin with, we have not done our act of justice.<br />
      Watson: So you’re staying up awake to watch the neighbourhood? Just set up cameras and<br />
      get some sleep. Come on Detective, use those brains and take some rest.<br />
      Sherlock: Oh my! I almost forgot about the half brain I left in the fridge to analyze. Maybe<br />
      sometime tonight.<br />
      Watson: Are you serious? How many times ...<br />
      BEEP<br />
      Sherlock: We have a message on our website. Another fan message ? Someone go get<br />
      these kids some comics and keep them quiet.<br />
      Watson: Let me check... What’s the passcode again? 221B?<br />
      Sherlock: Maybe. You’re the one who comes up with these hilarious codes. Didn’t you pick<br />
      that up from the military?<br />
      Watson: Sherlock, it is him.<br />
      Sherlock: My brother Mycroft? How many times have I told him to ...<br />
      Watson: No, It is from Jim Moriarty.<br />
      Sherlock: .... Must be someone just messing around with us<br />
      Watson: I doubt it. You should read this<br />

      Subject: Greetings from the grave, Sherlock<br />
      Em SsIm UoY dId ?<br />
      <br />
      SH,<br />
      It took me some time to figure out the best way to get to you.<br />
      My dead skeleton at your doorstep?<br />
      An explosion note at the centre of the nation?<br />
      Or even better, kidnap Watson (again) and get you to find me?<br />
      In the end, I decided digital approach is the way to go. I know you’re bored, deep inside, of<br />
      these petty case, for there is just so little chaos the world can offer. You were the reason<br />
      why I decided to leave the world, just to watch you burn alive.<br />
      But how does someone from the grave watch the world?<br />
      How does the past admire the future?<br />
      How am I still breathing?<br />
      You might find this hilarious or extremely horrifying, but I have found a way to cheat death.<br />
      People thought all those Norse mythology with the tree of life was all but a myth, but for me<br />
      that was a path to discover meaningful afterlife.<br />
      So Sherlock, even if you cannot see me in flesh and blood, I assure you the stakes are very<br />
      real. You faked your death, yet found a way out. My escape is way more elegant.<br />
      I owe you a good game. A much better version. Something you need to deduce.<br />
      I am an immortal, and so am back to strike a deal.<br />
      Solve all the riddles I offer you next, and I will tell you what I really have become.<br />
      Remember, I can forgive your errors, but I cannot wait forever. So once the clock starts<br />
      ticking, you will see the shimmering light fade away gradually. Will you make it out before<br />
      that? Only time can tell.<br />
      Try to route back to me, and you’ll get lost in transmission. Call the cops, and I assure you<br />
      things won’t go well, darling. Even if your big brother Mycroft comes to rescue you, the<br />
      repercussions great London faces will be catastrophic.<br />
      So if you’re up to the game, let us begin.<br />
      XOXO<br />
      JM<br />

      Watson: What do we do, Sherlock? Is this fake?<br />
      <br />
      Sherlock: Moriarty is dead, all roads lead to this fact. But if this is real, I am curious to know<br />
      who is behind the mask. Besides, if insomnia is hitting me, might as well play along with his<br />
      tides.<br />
      <br />
      And so, this is how it all began<br />
